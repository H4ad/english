## George Clooney Gave $1 Million Cash to 14 Friends

No, it's (to be) not a movie: actor George Clooney actually gave (past of give) 14 of his friends (multiple friend) $1 million each — all in cash.

The world learned (ed = past) about the gifts in a 2017 interview with Clooney's (genitive case) friend Rande Gerber. At the time, nobody was (to be (simple past)) sure if the story was (to be (simple past)) true. However, Clooney recently confirmed (ed = past form) it while talking to the magazine GQ.

In 2013, Clooney's (genitive case) movie Gravity made (make => past form) $723 million at cinemas around the world, and the star wanted (want => past form) to give something back to the friends who had (past of have) given him money and places to sleep when he was (simple past) poor.

Clooney wasn't (to be (simple past)) married yet, and had no children — he and international lawyer Amal Alamuddin didn't (simple past) marry until September 2014. His friends were (to be (simple past)) in his will (i don't know what means this phrase), but the actor didn't (to be (simple past)) want to wait until he died to give them (object pronoun) money.

So Clooney, now 59, filled (fill = ed = simple past) 14 bags with cash and invited (invite = ed = simple past) his friends to his home.

The friends found (find => past from) a black bag in front of each of them at Clooney's table, Gerber told(tell => past form) MSNBC in 2017. "We open it up, and it's (to be) $1 million in $20 bills."

According to Business Insider, Clooney didn't (simple past) just pay $14 million, however. He also would have had (have had, it's a structure right? But i don't know what structure) to pay tax on the gifts, which could have added (add => past form) another $3.5 million to the total.
