## Portuguese Island Opens Remote Working Community

As the coronavirus pandemic continues (s from simple present) to affect how the world lives and works (simple present again), a Portuguese island has created (d because is past) a community for remote workers to try and bring people to the area.

From February 1 to June 30, the village of Ponta do Sol on Madeira Island is offering (ing because is doing something) remote workers a free working (ing again) space with a desk and chair at the John dos Passos Cultural Center, which also has free internet.

About 8,200 people live in Ponta do Sol, a 500-year-old village known for being the warmest (add est because of intensity) part of Madeira Island, which is located about 700 kilometers west of Morocco in the North Atlantic Ocean.

Workers (s for multiple worker) have to stay for at least one month — and they (object pronoun) must pay for accommodation, although some guesthouses (s to indicate multiple) in the area have special offers for remote workers.

The project is (is not "are" because of project is in singular form) being run by the government of Madeira and a group called StartUp Madeira.

Gonçalo Hall is a remote work consultant helping (ing because they are doing something) to start the community. He (pronoun) told CNN: "With many people leaving big cities (ies = more than one city) right now, we wanted a village in a smaller place where people can create deeper connections than in a city."

Hall said (past of say) that more than 2,000 people from around the world had registered (had -ed for past perfect) their (possessive adjetive) interest in the community. There is enough space for up to 100 workers to begin with, but there are plans to expand to other buildings (s = multiple) in the village and also to other parts of the island.

At the 2020 World Travel Awards, Madeira was voted Europe's ('s because it's not "top island of Europe" - genitive case) top island destination for the seventh time in eight years.
