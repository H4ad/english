# Writing - What do you do in your free time?

## First Version

Usually in my free time, most of the time, I play CS:GO with my friend and sometimes I spent the time reading novels.
At the past, I had to be more creative because I didn't had a computer powerful enough to play games, so I only went from my house to ride with my skate and to play football.
For the future, I want to spend my free time writing and learning more about programming while I keep doing my freelances to buy new stuffs for my PC and my house.

## Second Version

Usually in my free time, most of the time, I play CS:GO with my friend.
We like to play in a map called Vertigo, that is on a skyscraper under construction.
Sometimes we play Age of Mythology which is a strategy game and you need to control your civilization
and manage them to construct new buildings and create more villagers to get more gold, wood and food.
Rarely, I do freelance building websites, APIs and mobile apps which is a very good source of extra money in the month.

At the past, I had to be more creative because I didn't had a computer powerful enough to play games.
So, my younger version managed this issue going outside to skateboarding and play soccer.
In just a few cases, I was too determinate to ride with a skateboard, so me and my friends went to Abaet√©, which is a park
with a large area and at this park we can find a skate lane with a lot of possibilities to do as many things as we wanted.

For the future, I want to spend my free time writing and learning more about programming while I keep doing my freelances to buy
new stuffs for my PC and my house.
Maybe my next purchase will be a headphone, I have a good one that is an Edifier 800bt, but, I want a better headphone with noise cancelling
and other fancy stuffs. I don't need those things now but I hope the future version of me will be richer.
