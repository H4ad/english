# Give your opinion

Some people believe that good teamwork is what makes companies successful. Others feel that it is more important to have a good leader. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

## My Opinion

I believe that have a good teamwork is the key of successful for a company because in a big project you need to deal with too many people at same time and having a good teamwork help you and the team to reach the goal of the project.

Otherwise, a presence of a good leader is important but not too much if the team doesn't have a good teamwork. You can have a great leader but without a team, you cannot reach any goal of your project, or even if reach, maybe the solution could not be better because your team didn't had a good communication about the necessities of the project.

You can argue that having both is the best option, an I agree, but if you have only one chance to make a choice: in one hand, you have a bad leader and a co-worker that you have a good relation, in other hand, you have a great leader but you need to deal with a bad co-worker that don't know nothing about what you need todo. You maybe can handle a bad leader but a bad co-worker is much hard to deal because you need to interact more with the co-worker than the leader.
