# Give your opinion

Some people believe that good teamwork is what makes companies successful. Others feel that it is more important to have a good leader. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

## My Opinion

I believe that have a good teamwork is the key of successful for a company because in a big project you need to deal with too many people at same time and having a good teamwork help you and the team to reach the goal of the project.

Otherwise, a presence of a good leader is important but not too much if the team doesn't have a good teamwork. You can have a great leader but without a team, you cannot reach any goal of your project, or even if reach, maybe the solution could not be better because your team didn't had a good communication about the necessities of the project.

You can argue that having both is the best option, an I agree, but if you have only one chance to make a choice: in one hand, you have a bad leader and a co-worker that you have a good relation, in other hand, you have a great leader but you need to deal with a bad co-worker that don't know nothing about what you need todo. You maybe can handle a bad leader but a bad co-worker is much hard to deal because you need to interact more with the co-worker than the leader.

### The Text

The people have two views about what make companies successful. In one hand, the people believe that having good teamwork is the key of the successful, in other hand, others could put the success of the companies because they have a good leader. While having good teamwork is good for the company, I disagree that is the good teamwork that could guide the company to the success rather than having great leaders to guide the company.

When you get a project, you need to estimate correctly based on the business rules that the client tells to you and show to him what's the project's price. Having a leader that is not too prepared to handle this issues is too danger for the successful of the project and by the consequence, could affect the company. Of course, this is one tiny part of the entire management of the project and going more deeply, your leader need to have a good understanding about how to priorize the tasks to deliver more value to your client and block those tasks that are impossible to accomplish in the amount of time that you get from client.

Indeed, having a good teamwork is helpful but your leader should know if the co-worker can handle the tasks or they could not, and if they failed to handle this, you could slow the deliver of the tasks, compromising the schedule. Furthermore, the leader can block features that are impossible todo because he knows about the business and knows his team rather than the team that doesn't have any power to choice what feature should made.

In conclusion, the key of successful of companies could be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to good teamwork and good leaders. The companies should priorize having good leaders because they are the person that could decide what is the future of the company and they could handle the issues with minimal damage for the company.
