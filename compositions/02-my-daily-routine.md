# My Daily Routine

## First Try

I wake up at 30 past 8 and usually take the phone to see any updates on Facebook. After couple minutes scrolling down the screen, I go to kitchen and turn on the "Treco de aquecer água" to make some tea and turn on my computer.
In some days I eat some cookies, in other days I eat bread, depends on humor of my brother to get out of my house to buy these kinds of foods. And in this time, I like to keep up my novels, I only have 1 chapter to read everyday, it's became to me a ritual that I never skip.

After breakfast, I start the work entering on Discord to talk with my co-workers. In a day, I do many things depending on what I was designated todo in that specific day but in rare exceptions I only spent the hole day in reunions and in the end of the day, I wrote almost nothing of code. For me, days with reunions is too boring because I like to programming instead spending hours talking with other people.

At 12'O Clock my brother starts to cook and I usually made a stop to have my lunch. I like to see some podcasts or tech videos in that one hour, it seen to forward too fast and 20 minutes before ending my lunch, I go to kitchen to wash the dishes, the most boring thing in my day.

After work, I take the bathroom and eat some snacks to go to college. Because of pandemic, all classes are on internet by Zoom. I like the idea of don't moving to some place only to have class and stay the entire day at the same place.

After four hours of study, only left to me one hour to spent anything that I want. I like to spent this time playing CS:GO with my co-worker Henrique, both of us are AK-2 and almost all of yours matches are very funny. When we play with their friends that are "Xerife", the matches became more challenger at same time that became more funniest.

And in the end, I wash my tooth and go to the bed to have 8 hours of sleep.
