# How close are we to uploading our minds?

This a resume about a TED talk.

## First Try

The talk starts with him explaining the steps of uploading our mind and they show what we need.

First, they explore the biological issues of this huge task of uploading our mind. For this task,
we need to understand what we need to save and have an understanding of how things works to recreate
our brain.

At this point, he show some structures that we have in our mind, like the neurons, connectome
and glia, these structures do many things in our brain and do even things that we don't know yet. The
problem start with these structures that we don't know too much about, how we can reproduce such a thing that
we don't know?

After this problem, we have another, even that we could have an understanding of these structures, how we can scan
a brain with enough precision? With actual technology, the power of magnetic field necessary to scan all our brain
is enough to burn the people that is scanned. Has a alternative that we could do this with dead brains, but the
pre-condition of this alternative is that you need to die.

The second part explains some of technological difficulties like have enough computing power and storage space to
storage and process an entire brain. And this issue is one of the easiest because year after year we see a hugh
improvement of our technology, and in the future, we could even use quantum computers to perform this tasks.
At the time of the publication of this talk, nobody yet built an IA with more than 86 billion neurons, but
last year (2020), one year after the publication of the video, was released in July an IA with 175 billion neurons,
and we could expect more improvements and hugh IA with more and more neurons to process our brains.

And in the end, they leave to us some ethical questions like:

- Who would have access to mind uploading?
- How could this technology be abused?
- What rights would be accorded to uploaded minds?

These are such good questions that I cannot have good answers but I expect the future version of me could answer
this open questions before the uploading mind area.

I hope that I will be alive to see this technology, I am a hugh fan o Sword Art Online that is a game that players
play the game by using an headset that send our mind to game world and I hope to see some kinds of games like this,
except of the part that people die in real life when die in the game rsrs

## The Correct One

The talk starts with him explaining the steps of uploading our mind and they show what we need.

After this problem, we have another, even that we could have an understanding of these structures, how can we scan
a brain with enough precision? With actual technology, the power of magnetic field necessary to scan all our brain
is enough to burn the person that is scanned. `Has` an alternative that we could do this with dead brains, but the
pre-condition of this alternative is that you need to die.

The second part explains some of technological difficulties like: have enough computing power and storage space to
store and process an entire brain. And this issue is one of the easiest because year after year we see a huge

By time of the publication of this talk, nobody yet built an IA with more than 86 billion neurons, but
last year (2020), one year after the publication of the video, it was released in July an IA with 175 billion neurons,
and we could expect more improvements and huge IA development with more and more neurons to process our brains.

And in the end, they leave us some ethical questions like:

- Who would have access to mind uploading?
- How could this technology be abused?
- What rights would be accorded to uploaded minds?

These are such good questions that I cannot answer but I expect the future version of me would be able to answer
this opened questions before the uploading mind era.

I hope that I will be alive to see this technology, I am a huge fan of Sword Art Online that is a game that players
play the game by using a helmet that send our mind to the world of this game and I hope to see some kinds of games like this,
except the part that people die in real life when die in the game rsrs
