# My Last Trip

I don't know exactly when was my last trip, but I will talk about one that I go years ago to other state to see the marry of my [cousin].
The trip was very good on the way to Parana, it was 6 hours or more in the car and we stopped in the half of way to drink water, make pee
and see the nature, the place that we stopped was very beautiful.

When we finally [arrived] to the "chacará", I only could think that i need to sleep and get some rest. The place was very beautiful, they even
  had a pool, a very big pool that made me spend many hours [swimming]. I have too much luck in that day because I don't get burnt by sun.

The people was very kind, the entire family of my father go to this marriage and had some people too that I could not recognized. One of the people
that I don't know about was a girl, a beautiful girl that I spent the hole trip crush, nothing happens because I was very shy to go to talk with that girl.
After couple days, she's cousin mother sent message to me to talk about their daughter that get interest in me, I become very disappointed when I finally see the
girl because I don't know if the woman was the girl that I was crush or it was other girl, so I accumulate too many hype only to see a girl that wasn't the girl
that I was crush.

In the way to go back to my home, the weather was very bad and rainy alot, in some hours I thought that I was die beucase the weather become too bad and my father
don't stopped in any place and only continued to drive to home. My happiness in that day was I finally see the sign of my city saying "Welcome", is very good back to home.

# The Correct One

I don't know exactly when my last trip was, but I will talk about one that I went years ago to other state to see the marriage of my [cousin].
The trip was very good [on the way] to Parana (The trip to Parana was very good), it took 6 hours or more in the car and we stopped in the half of way to drink water, pee
and see the nature, the place that we stopped was very beautiful.

When we finally [arrived] at the Farm House ("Chacará"), I could only think that I needed to sleep and get some rest. The place was very beautiful, they even
  had a pool, a very big pool that made me spend many hours [swimming]. I was so luck that day because I didn't get [burnt] by sun.

The people were very kind, the father's entire family went to this marriage and there were some people too that I could not recognized. One of the people
that I didn't know about was a girl, a beautiful girl that I spent the hole trip [crushing], nothing happened because I was very shy to go to talk with that girl.
After couple days, her mother's cousin sent a message to me to talk about their daughter that got interest on me, I became very disappointed when I finally saw the
girl because I didn't know if the woman was the girl that I had a crush or it was other girl, so I got too hyped only to see a girl that wasn't the girl
that I had a crush.

On the way to go back home, the weather was very bad and rained a lot, sometimes I thought that I was going to die because the weather became too bad and my father
didn't stop in any place and only continued to drive home. My happiness in that day was when I finally saw the sign of my city saying "Welcome"... is very good back to be home.
